# Project Overview

This project is a web application with a Python-based backend and a JavaScript-based frontend. The backend handles the server-side logic and data management, while the frontend provides a dynamic and interactive user interface. For the frontend design, I used Figma to create a mockup of the application.

The main purpose of this project is to try different technologies and tools and learn how to integrate them to build a full-stack web application. Furthermore, I wanted to try working with an auto-resetting database by utilizing the ephermal storage of the Heroku platform.
